It's been a long time since I posted, so there's a lot to catch up on.

---

__Ghana__

I like [Ghana](https://dylan.is/photos/ghana-2020/1). I went here in January
2020, but never ended up making a post for it. Unfortunately, I don't feel
much like going through my notes and writing up a blog post on it. It was a
lovely country though. Probably my favorite on my west africa trip. Also,
don't know if I mentioned it, but made a good friend here that I am traveling
with.

__Sudan__

I like [Sudan](https://dylan.is/photos/sudan-2020/1). I went here in November
2020. It was great to travel again. Half the group ended up with COVID-19, but
amazingly I wasn't one of them. I was actually a little disappointed. I thought
maybe I got it without having any symptoms. That'd have been nice, so I didn't
have to worry about it anymore. Fortunately, I've since gotten vaccinated and
I never ended up getting it.

Sudanese people are unique in all the African countries I've been to. They are
incredibly reserved, but some of the most friendly people I've ever met once
you get to talk to them. You would go into a shop, and no one would approach you,
but as soon as you asked a question, it was like a switch was flipped. They
became your best friend. It was safe to walk outside at night too, which was
an interesting experience.

Also, pyramids are cool, and I slept outside next to the MeroÃ« pyramids. Gas
shortages are less cool. Small tip, when going to a camel market, make sure
you find the correct market, and don't go to the general livestock market.
Very different vibes there.

__Vaccine__

I've been vaccinated for a month now, and still haven't traveled anywhere!

---

__Notes__

I updated my [note](https://github.com/dylanarmstrong/note) app to use a
sqlite database that I symlinked into my iCloud.

---

__Photos__

I made a simple photo website and went through and uploaded all my 2020
trips.

It's available [here](https://dylan.is/photos).

I've posted the source code [here](https://github.com/dylanarmstrong/photos).

__Crosswords__

I got really into crosswords so I decided to make a `.puz` parser and a crossword
site.

A live version is available [here](https://dylan.is/crossword).

It's also available under a MIT license.  Here's the
[parser](https://github.com/dylanarmstrong/puz) and the
[website](https://github.com/dylanarmstrong/crossword).

The website is interesting, performance was the most interesting part of it. I
have never done a game before, and making it performant was fun.

I ended up going with a canvas using
[react-konva](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva).

---

__Rescript__

Got really into this for a couple weeks, but trying to actually make a website
with it was a pain in the ass. I got a working web server using bs-express, but
getting SSR working was a nightmare. No matter what I tried with bs-css, I could
not get components to be the same for proper hydrating.

I think the community may be dead, and what the heck is the relationship between
ReasonML and Rescript? They both have ongoing development?

:(

__Hugo__

I've converted this blog to Hugo from Gatsby. I tried to update my Gatsby version
to 3 (from 2), and it became a whole mess. Hugo is actually a much simpler to use
blogging system. I don't need all the fancy JS, when a static blog is just a lot
simpler.

It took a second to get the style to match exactly, but it is completely
indistinguishable from the Gatsby version of this blog.

I've posted the source code [here](https://github.com/dylanarmstrong/blogging).

__Future__

I've got several upcoming trips booked, and I'm moving to the city next weekend.

I've even booked my first trip of 2022 already.

I've got a lot of work to do if I expect to get all 195, considering I'm short 158...

I've been to 37 countries now, but I only really started traveling in 2016.
So 25 countries since November 2016. In 2020, I was planning on taking a
4 month sabbatical and going to ~20 countries, but that did not work out.

In 2016, it really started when I was thinking about going to England,
and I asked myself "Well, why don't I book a flight?" so I booked a flight
for a few weeks out. It was fun, I didn't even realize that my passport
expired too close to the trip, and I had to get an emergency passport.

Here's the country count for the most recent years:

|Year|#|List
--- | --- | ---
2016|2|England, France
2017|8|Botswana, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Namibia, Spain, Vatican, Zimbabwe
2018|5|Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, United Arab Emirates, Uganda
2019|5|Cambodia, Japan, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam
2020|5|Benin, Ghana, Sudan, Togo, Turkey
2021|5|TBA
2022|6|TBA

I said "I've" a lot in this post.
